# LUDO Philosophy

## What it wants to solve
- Goal: Ship small games fast, keep code changeable, avoid “big framework” gravity.
- Constraints: Solo/small team, Unity 6, WebGL/mobile targets, short sessions, tight loops.
- Invariants: Deterministic boot, in-editor start from any scene, clear ownership, low coupling, easy to delete/replace.
